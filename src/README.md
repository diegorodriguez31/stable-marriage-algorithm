#Objective of the project

This project aims to implement by ourselves the stable marriage algorithm also calles the
Gale-Shapley algorithm. We studied it during the Graph Theory lessons at Enseeiht, an engineer school
in Toulouse. Usually, the given example for this problem refers to men serenading women. In our case,
we had to create the same situation that faces parcoursup, an online platform which assigns post-bac
students into schools.

In the real situation, students are bidding schools and schools choose the students 



We had to let the user able to create source files and / or to modify existing ones. A source file
contains two groups on which apply the algorithm. We also had to let the user choose the group
who serenade. We were free to choose the programming language to develop this algorithm and
the technology / syntax of source files.
We decided to go with Python because it's an high-level language which is quite simple to use
and very flexible. However, Python isn't robust and performing. If we had to make this algorithm
efficient for an high-number of elements, we would choose C++, Rust, or another low-level
language.
Regarding source files, we decided to use the YAML language. It is an alternative of XML / JSON.
YAML has the advantage of being human-readable. Indeed, its syntax is minimal. Another reason
for choosing YAML is the fact that Python has a YAML parser called PyYAML which make YAML
files easy to use in Python.
